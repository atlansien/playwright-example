## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

### Running Playwright Tests

This project includes Playwright for end-to-end and visual snapshot testing.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Updating Snapshots

If you've made intentional UI changes and need to update the snapshots:

```bash
npm run test:update-snapshots
```

The snapshot references are stored in the `tests/test-1.spec.ts-snapshots` directory.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.

## Continuous Integration

This project is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on pull requests and pushes to the main branch. The workflow configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`.
